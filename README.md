# gesture-controlled-car

We developed gloves that serve as remote controls for a small car. Simple, intuitive gestures are all one needs to control the car.

Future versions of this car can be outfitted with rough-terrain traversing capabilities, enabling it to be able to deliver much needed supplies to areas in need.
